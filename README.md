# Medical Data Exchange

This round implements one explicitly scoped local exchange format, `medlocal.v1`,
and imports it into versioned unified records.

## Entity Identity

Records are keyed by `(source.id, record.type, record.id)`. An update to the same
source-local id therefore updates one internal object and never creates a second
patient with the same id. Patient names and other attributes are never used to
infer links.

`patient_ref` and `encounter_ref` always contain source-local record ids. If the
target has not arrived yet, the relationship is retained as pending. Later import
of the exact referenced id resolves it; a same-name record does not.

## Import Bundle

```json
{
  "format": "medlocal.v1",
  "source": {"id": "hospital-a", "name": "Hospital A"},
  "records": [
    {"id": "p-1", "type": "patient", "version": 1, "data": {"name": "Zhang San"}},
    {"id": "e-1", "type": "encounter", "version": 1, "data": {"patient_ref": "p-1"}},
    {
      "id": "o-1",
      "type": "observation",
      "version": 1,
      "data": {
        "patient_ref": "p-1",
        "encounter_ref": "e-1",
        "code": "CBC"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Malformed JSON or an unsupported envelope is a whole-bundle failure. Within a
valid envelope, records have individual success/failure boundaries. Identical
`(id, type, version, content)` is reported as `duplicate` and is not counted
again. Same version with different content is a conflict; older versions arriving
after a newer current version are rejected.

## Export

`export_bundle(store)` returns `unified.records.v1` with sources, current entity
data, retained version hashes, resolved relationships, and pending relationships.
This makes patient → encounter → observation links explicit and allows their
correspondence to be checked after export.

Run tests with:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python -m unittest discover -s tests
```
